    "Forest ecosystems are known to provide important ecosystem services including water and air purification. While they play a key role in climate change mitigation as carbon sinks, forests are similarly, very sensitive to the poresent ongoing global climate warming [$^{1}$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710007140?casa_token=eVchPGEdax8AAAAA:IivvV6JwDaHCyOWAAaP724OtaWGStEbTzXcZh-xYFVlYYtZzLnzxzaSkfUuBUdLSD8FtBm1mEpk). During the month of April 2018, a high-pressure system established over Central Europe and lasted almost consistently until mid of October. This resulted in a long-lasting drought spell and record temperatures in central and northern Europe. The impacts of the drought event included deminished ecosystem health especially in forested areas[$^{2}$](https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2019-286/bg-2019-286.pdf). In Germany, the warm conditions resulted in Pests such as bark beetle proliferation. As such, the pests' population dramatically escalated to a point they bacame a threat to the foreat ecosystem. As evidence, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) reported a record 32 million cubic meteres of timber harvested as a result of pest infestation in the year 2019. These numbers are way overboard when compred to the preceding years (11 and 6 million cubic metere in 2018 and 2017 respectively)[$^{3}$](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2020/07/PE20_N041_412.html).\n",
